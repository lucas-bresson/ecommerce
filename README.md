## About

This project was inspired by ["Full Stack Ecommerce Store With Admin Dashboard From Scratch - Next.js, Prisma, Stripe, Tailwind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqrgggs0Qk0)

Code would be organized differently on a real production application. The goal here was to setup the basic features of a fullstack ecommerce website with a minimal amount of code and no particular design effort. It includes a payment flow, email confirmation after purchase, and an admin dashboard to add or edit products.

Clone the repo locally and visit localhost:3000/admin to see the admin dashboard. You can log in with admin / password.
To test the payment flow, you can use the dev defaults for Stripe: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any expiration date and CVC.
